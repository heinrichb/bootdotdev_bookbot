# 📚 BookBot (Python)

This repository contains the **BookBot** project, developed as part of the [Boot.dev course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-bookbot-python). The goal of this project is to create a Python-based CLI tool that analyzes text files, reinforcing core programming and text-processing concepts.

## 🚀 Features

- **Word Count**: Calculate the total number of words in a text file.
- **Character Analysis**: Identify and count unique characters and their occurrences.
- **Text Insights**: Provide meaningful statistics about the text, such as word frequency.
- **File Handling**: Efficiently read and process text files.
- **Customizable Analysis**: Easily extend the functionality for deeper text analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for development.
- **File I/O**: Reading and writing files in Python.
- **CLI Design**: Simple and intuitive command-line interface.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensuring reliability with Python's `unittest` framework.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Parsing and analyzing text files programmatically.
- Using Python’s built-in libraries for efficient file and string manipulation.
- Designing user-friendly CLI tools.
- Writing clean and maintainable Python code.
- Implementing and running unit tests to ensure functionality.

## 🧪 Testing

Unit tests were written to validate:

- Accurate word and character counts.
- Proper handling of empty or malformed files.
- Correct text statistics and analysis results.

Run tests with:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## 🌟 Why This Project?

The BookBot project was built to strengthen my Python development skills by:

- Practicing text processing and data analysis.
- Building a functional CLI tool with real-world applications.
- Learning to write robust and reusable code.
